# Simple Reinforcement Learning Environment
- Training agents to navigate their way through a maze by maximising reward. Random, Basic and Intelligent Policies are defined for agents and compared. From the comparison of mean reward after defining policies, it can be seen that the intelligent policy is best able to maximise reward as expected. 
- In this project, I have also attempted to make use of Classes and Functions in a more effective manner.
